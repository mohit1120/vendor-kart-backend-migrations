- Feature/bug fix branches created from `dev`.

### Pull Request Process

- PRs from feature/fix branches to `dev`.
- Approval by two reviewers required.
- Code quality, testing, issue relevance checked.

### Testing

- Unit tests for components/functions.
- Integration tests for module interaction.
- End-to-end testing for application flow.

### Merge to Main

- PR from `dev` to `main` after testing/approval.
- Approval by two reviewers for main branch stability.

### Deployment

- Changes deployed to dev environment post `main` merge.
- Release creation from `main` for production deployment.
- Monitoring for performance and issue detection.
- Bug triage, resolution, maintenance processes established.
