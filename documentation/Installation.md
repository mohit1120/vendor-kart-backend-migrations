### Installing and Connecting to Database using DBeaver

This guide will walk you through the process of installing DBeaver and connecting to a database.

#### Steps

1. Go to the [DBeaver website](https://dbeaver.io/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

#### Connecting to a Database

1. Launch DBeaver.
2. Click on the "New Connection" button in the toolbar, or go to `Database` -> `New Connection`.

3. In the "New Connection" dialog, select the database type you want to connect to (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.) and click "Next".

4. Fill in the connection details:

   - **Host:** The hostname or IP address of the database server.
   - **Port:** The port number on which the database server is running.
   - **Database:** The name of the database you want to connect to.
   - **Username:** Your database username.
   - **Password:** Your database password.

5. Click "Test Connection" to verify that the connection settings are correct and DBeaver can connect to the database successfully. If the test is successful, click "Finish" to save the connection.

6. The new connection will appear in the DBeaver workspace. Double-click on it to establish a connection to the database.

7. You can now explore the database structure, run queries, and perform various database operations using DBeaver.
